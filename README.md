## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! This project highlights my work as a cloud developer building scalable, event-driven serverless applications using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. It demonstrates how to architect modern cloud-native solutions that are lightweight, cost-effective, and secureâ€”without managing traditional servers.

At the heart of this application is an event-driven architecture, where AWS Lambda functions are triggered by a variety of sources, including HTTP requests via API Gateway, message queues (SQS), file uploads (S3), and scheduled events (CloudWatch Events). This decoupled, asynchronous design allows each service to scale independently and respond to workload spikes with zero manual intervention.

A key benefit of the serverless model is cost-efficiency. With AWS Lambdaâ€™s pay-per-execution pricing and automatic scaling, this project eliminates idle server costs while ensuring high availability. Services are provisioned on demand, and infrastructure is defined using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like AWS SAM or CloudFormation to ensure repeatability and version control.

Security is a top priority throughout the project. API Gateway endpoints are protected using IAM roles, Lambda authorizers, or Amazon Cognito for authentication and authorization. Fine-grained IAM policies enforce the principle of least privilege, and environment variables are securely managed using AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store.

Whether you're exploring the serverless ecosystem or building production-ready cloud applications, this repository provides a hands-on reference for building modular, secure, and cost-effective solutions on AWS. Feel free to browse the code, deploy the stack, or customize it for your own workflows.
